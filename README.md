# Entire-framework-challenge


Implemented a React application that fetches menuItems from the graphql endpoint and displays them as a menu.

    - On clicking on the menu item it should navigate to the subpage defined in url, collapsing the clicked menu item and expanding a previously hidden one.
    - Both items (expanding and collapsing) have 1s ease transition for the menu item box size.
    - The menu items order does not change.
    - There is no empty spaces between menu items.
